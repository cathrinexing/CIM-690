                    <br>
                    As for my background, I got my bachelor’s and master’s degree in china majoring in urban planning and design. Also, I have worked for about 3-4 years in an urban planning and design provincial study institution in china. I have been the project leader for several plans and a participant several times. I mainly focus on two big kinds of plans: statutory plan and urban design. My work main content is to make the framework, the conception of the plan. Also, I always went on business trips to investigate the cites or the specific districts which I was going to make plans. The important part is that I had to report my plans to the clients, usually the governments, and the experts in different fields, such as the transportation, infrastructure, environmental protection, finance department and so on. Cause urban planning is a comprehensive and complicated complex. Also, I had to revise the plan according to their advices or give them my explanations to them why I refuse to modify my plan in some point. It turns out to be a lot of negotiations and compromises. In fact, I feel very proud when the cities or the district are built based on my plan. You know, it is a kind of achievement.
