               <i style="font-size:18px">Here are some pieces of my projects that I have conducted in china.</i> 
                    <br>
                    As for my background, I got my bachelor’s and master’s degree in China majoring in urban planning and design. Also, I have worked for about 3-4 years in an urban planning and design provincial study institution. I used to be a project leader for several plans and a participant for many times. I mainly focus on two big categories of plans: statutory plan and urban design. My work main content is to make the framework and the conception of the plan. Also, I always went on business trip to investigate the cites or some specific districts where I was required to make plans. The important part is that I had to report my plans to the clients- the governments, and the experts in different fields, such as the transportation, infrastructure, environmental protection, finance department and so on. Beyond doubt, urban planning is a comprehensive and complicated complex. Also, I had to revise the plan according to their advices or give them my explanations why I refuse to modify my plan in some degree. It turns out to be a lot of negotiations and compromises. In fact, I feel very proud when the cities or the district are built based on my plan. You know, it is a kind of achievement.
